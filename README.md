# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project implements a linear regression model in Python to predict house prices. Leveraging essential libraries such as NumPy and Pandas for data cleaning, Matplotlib for data visualization, and Scikit-learn (Sklearn) for model building, this application aims to provide accurate predictions based on input features.

## Technologies Used

- *Python:* Primary programming language.
  
- *NumPy and Pandas:* Utilized for efficient data cleaning and manipulation.
  
- *Matplotlib:* Employed for visualizing key insights from the dataset.
  
- *Scikit-learn (Sklearn):* Used to build and train the linear regression model.

- *Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm:* IDEs utilized for development.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model includes relevant features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and other factors affecting house prices.

## Implementation Steps

1. *Data Cleaning:* Use NumPy and Pandas to preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, and ensuring data quality.

2. *Data Visualization:* Utilize Matplotlib to visualize relationships between different features and the target variable (house prices).

3. *Feature Selection:* Identify and select relevant features for training the linear regression model.

4. *Model Building:* Use Sklearn to implement a linear regression model and train it on the prepared dataset.

5. *Model Evaluation:* Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics, considering factors like mean squared error or R-squared.

6. *Prediction:* Implement functionality to take user inputs and predict house prices using the trained model.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn installed on your system.

2. Clone the repository to your local machine.

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script in your preferred IDE (Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, or PyCharm).

4. Run the script to execute the house price prediction model.

## Future Enhancements

Future updates to the project may include the incorporation of advanced regression techniques, fine-tuning hyperparameters, and expanding the dataset for improved accuracy.
